# Design Decisions & Architecture Explanation

## Employee Data Generation & Visualization System

This document explains the architectural choices, technologies used, and reasoning behind key design decisions for the Employee Management System built during the 3-hour development challenge.

## üèóÔ∏è Overall Architecture

### Chosen Architecture: **Django REST API with PostgreSQL**

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Mature, well-documented framework with built-in features for authentication, serialization, and API documentation
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with excellent Django integration and support for complex queries
- **Modular App Structure**: Separated concerns into distinct Django apps for maintainability

### Alternative Considered:
- **Flask + SQLAlchemy**: Lighter weight but would require more manual configuration
- **FastAPI**: Modern and fast, but less mature ecosystem for rapid development

## üìä Database Design

### Normalized Relational Model

**Core Tables:**
1. **Department** - Company organizational units
2. **Employee** - Central entity with personal and professional data
3. **Attendance** - Daily attendance tracking
4. **Performance** - Quarterly/annual reviews
5. **Salary** - Salary history and adjustments

**Key Design Decisions:**

#### 1. Foreign Key Relationships
```python
# Employee belongs to Department (Many-to-One)
department = models.ForeignKey(Department, on_delete=models.PROTECT)

# Department can have manager (One-to-One with Employee)  
manager = models.ForeignKey('Employee', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
```

**Rationale:** 
- `PROTECT` prevents accidental department deletion with active employees
- `SET_NULL` allows manager removal without data loss
- Maintains referential integrity while providing flexibility

#### 2. Computed Properties vs Stored Fields
```python
@property
def years_of_service(self):
    return (timezone.now().date() - self.hire_date).days // 365

@property  
def overall_rating(self):
    return round((self.technical_skills + self.communication + 
                 self.teamwork + self.leadership) / 4, 2)
```

**Rationale:**
- Reduces data duplication
- Ensures consistency (always current calculation)
- Saves storage space
- Prevents stale computed values

#### 3. Audit Trail with History Tables
```python
class Salary(models.Model):
    effective_date = models.DateField()
    salary_type = models.CharField(choices=SALARY_TYPE_CHOICES)
    reason = models.TextField()
```

**Rationale:**
- Complete salary change history for compliance
- Enables trend analysis and reporting
- Audit trail for HR decisions

## üîß API Design

### RESTful Endpoints with ViewSets

**Architecture Choice:** Django REST Framework ViewSets
```python
class EmployeeViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Employee.objects.select_related('department', 'user').all()
    serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic CRUD endpoint generation
- Consistent URL patterns
- Built-in pagination and filtering
- Reduced boilerplate code

### Custom Actions for Business Logic
```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['get'])
def attendance_summary(self, request, pk=None):
    # Custom business logic for attendance analytics
```

**Rationale:**
- Extends standard REST patterns for domain-specific operations
- Maintains RESTful principles while adding functionality
- Clear separation between CRUD and analytics operations

## üîê Authentication & Security

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication

**Decision:** django-rest-framework-simplejwt
```python
SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=60),
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True,
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Stateless authentication (scalable)
- Built-in token refresh mechanism
- Secure token rotation
- Industry standard for API authentication

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```python
@method_decorator(ratelimit(key='user', rate='100/hour', method='ALL'))
```

**Implementation:**
- User-based rate limiting for authenticated requests
- IP-based for anonymous requests
- Different limits for different endpoint types (analytics vs CRUD)

**Rationale:**
- Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks
- Ensures fair resource usage
- Protects expensive analytics operations

## üìà Data Generation Strategy

### Faker Library for Realistic Data

**Choice:** Python Faker with custom business logic
```python
def create_employees(self, departments):
    position = random.choices(positions, weights=position_weights)[0]
    salary = Decimal(str(random.randint(min_salary, max_salary)))
```

**Benefits:**
- Realistic test data generation
- Configurable data volumes
- Maintains referential integrity
- Repeatable data scenarios

### Weighted Random Distribution
```python
positions = ['intern', 'junior', 'senior', 'lead', 'manager', 'director']
position_weights = [0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05]
```

**Rationale:**
- Reflects realistic organizational hierarchy
- Creates believable salary distributions
- Enables meaningful analytics testing

## üìä Analytics & Visualization

### Dual Visualization Strategy

**Frontend:** Chart.js + Plotly.js
- **Chart.js**: Simple charts (pie, bar, doughnut)
- **Plotly.js**: Complex visualizations (gauges, advanced charts)

**Backend:** Pandas for Data Processing
```python
def get(self, request):
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    if export_format == 'excel':
        df.to_excel(response, index=False)
```

**Rationale:**
- Chart.js: Lightweight, easy to implement
- Plotly: Rich interactive features
- Pandas: Powerful data manipulation for exports
- Separation of concerns (backend data, frontend presentation)

### Efficient Query Strategy
```python
queryset = Employee.objects.select_related('department', 'user').all()
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- `select_related` for foreign keys (reduces N+1 queries)
- Computed aggregations at database level
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching for expensive analytics queries

## üê≥ Deployment Strategy

### Docker Containerization

**Multi-Service Architecture:**
```yaml
services:
  web:      # Django application
  db:       # PostgreSQL database  
  redis:    # Cache/session storage
  nginx:    # Reverse proxy (production)
```

**Benefits:**
- Environment consistency
- Easy scaling and deployment
- Service isolation
- Development/production parity

### Environment Configuration
```python
SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY', default='django-insecure-default-key')
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=True, cast=bool)
```

**Rationale:**
- 12-factor app methodology
- Secure secret management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Easy deployment across environments

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Structure (Planned)
```python
class EmployeeModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_years_of_service_calculation(self):
        # Test computed properties
        
class EmployeeAPITest(APITestCase):
    def test_employee_creation(self):
        # Test API endpoints
```

**Approach:**
- Unit tests for models and business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Test data factories for consistent test scenarios
- Coverage reporting for quality assurance
